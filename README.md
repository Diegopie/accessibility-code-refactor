[Code Refractor](https://diegopie.github.io/accessibility-code-refactor/) is hosted on GitHub pages. 

## Outcome: 

This project taught me a lot about having a goal in mind when writing a web page. Not just in terms of readability for the coder, but for readability for screen readers too. All of this will affect the end user in different ways. 
I was able to research how screen readers analyze oneâ€™s HTML and make adjustments to respect accessibility and SEO standards. Writing good alt text was something I struggled with as I had only ever used a few words to describe an image in the past. 
I would still like to optimize the current CSS styles to reduce redundancy, but I need to sharpen my CSS skills. I would also like to make adjustments so the page can scale across screen sizes.
